        <h1>Welcome to ASKE</h1>
        <p class="text">This sequence is made up of poses that will improve your core strength and help flatten your abs. While doing yoga is not the best way to get a six-pack, you can expect to significantly tone and strengthen your belly. Strengthening your core can also help relieve back pain and improve your posture (nothing makes your belly look bigger than slouching!). Many of the poses recommended below are balances, which are a great way to work the core.</p>
